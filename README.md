TronDAOs is bringing off-chain voting to the Tron ecosystem by building with the design patterns used by popular DAO systems such as Snapshot.

This is made possible by using the TronLink wallet for verifying/authenticating wallets off-chain, Tron RPC API to get user voting power a proposal creation block height, and finally IPFS as decentralized storage.

TronDaos will also be providing API access and APK for platforms to be able to display proposals and voting details from their Dapps. They will also be able to programmatically manage space, create proposals, pass proposal, and other proposal settings
